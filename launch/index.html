        <h3>We are having a Launch GDI DFW Party on September 4th in Deep Ellum. 100% of sponsor dollars and items go toward the event costs. Please select a sponsorship package below to help with the event. As a 501(c)3 non-profit charity, we rely on the generosity of individuals, companies and other organizations to make Girl Develop it possible.</h3>
        <div id="about"></div>
        <h1 class="content-subhead">What is Girl Develop It?</h1>
        <h4>Girl Develop It is a charitable organization certified by the Board of Education, to provide low-cost software development learning opportunities to underrepresented groups, with a focus on women, in supportive, judgment-free environments. </h4>
        <p>Founded and managed by developers, our vision is to create a network of empowered women who feel confident in their abilities to code and build beautiful web and mobile applications.</p>
        <p>We aspire to increase the number of women pursuing computer based jobs, empower women to start their own online businesses, and enter traditionally male-dominated computer engineering career fields.</p>
        <p>Women of all ages, income levels, demographics and education levels are welcome to attend our high-value low-cost courses.</p>
        <p>By teaching women around the world from diverse backgrounds to learn software development, we can help women improve their careers and confidence in their everyday lives.</p>
        <div id="problem"></div>
        <h1 class="content-subhead">The Problem</h1>
        <p>From the National Center for Women &amp; Information technology scorecard:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the U.S. in 2009, women earned 57% of all undergraduate degrees, 52% of all math and science degrees, 59% of the undergraduate degrees in biology and 42% of mathematics degrees, but only 18% of all computer and information sciences undergraduate degrees.</li>
          <li>Women's quit rate in technology exceeds that in other science and engineering fields; 56% of women in technology companies leave their organizations at the mid-level point (10-20 years) in their careers.</li>
          <li>Despite the fact that about 46 percent of the workforce and more than 50 percent of college students are female, they represent only about 35 percent of startup business owners.</li>
          <li>1.4 million computer specialist job openings are expected in the U.S. by 2020.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Girl Scouts of the United States (statistics based on a group of 850 girls supplemented by literature and past research):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>About half of all girls feel that STEM isn't a typical career path for girls. 57% of girls say that if they went into a STEM career, they'd have to work harder than a man just to be taken seriously.</li>
          <li>81% of STEM girls are interested in pursuing STEM career, but only 13% say it is their first choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="who"></div>
        <h1 class="content-subhead">WHO, WHEN AND WHERE</h1>
        <h4>The official launch of Girl Develop It DFW will take place on 4th of September 2014. The launch party will be held at the beautiful Rachel Nash Gallery in Deep Ellum. </h4>
        <p><b>At A Glance<p></b>
        <p><b>200</b> developers, designers, and business owners; all looking to network and support the Dallas tech community.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Located in historic Deep Ellum</li>
          <li>2,200 sq ft open interior</li>
          <li>Free Admission</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>The Goal</b></p>
        <p>We would like to provide food, water, soft drinks and a bar. In addition, we would like to have a silent auction and/or raffle to benefit our scholarship fund. It will be a great place for sponsors to connect with our students, volunteers and greater Dallas community. Make your donation of food, drinks, door prizes, auction/raffle items, and/or DJ services and get access to our organization.</p>
        <p><b>Why Sponsor This?</b></p>
        <p>Our launch party will be chock-full of amazing people who are looking to learn and grow, and looking for companies that will help them in that endeavor through employment and partnerships. Sponsoring a local tech event like this is the perfect way to let all of the awesome developers, designers, project managers, &amp; software enthusiasts who are in attendance know that you are the kind of company that invests in a strong software community, and believes in the continuous growth and learning of your employees and partners.</p>
