          <h3>Teaching Assistants</h3>
          <p>We are so delighted that you want to join the GDI team! Please review this guidelines and requirements below.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">About TA'ing for Girl Develop It</h4>

          <p>Girl Develop It teaching assistants are awesome people who love sharing their knowledge with others and helping people one-on-one. You're not afraid of difficult questions, saying "I don't know", or Googling it. You don't have to be an expert, just an enthusiastic person with experience in the field.</p>

          <p>TAs are required to be present for the entire workshop unless otherwise requested. Note that some workshops take place in a single day session, while others are multi-week.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Curriculum</h4>

          <p>GDI uses nationally cultivated curriculum with modifications made by each class teacher. Materials will be emailed to you a week prior to class.</p>

          <p><em>You are required to review the material prior to volunteering as a teaching assistant for the course.</em></p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Payment</h4>

          <p>GDI teaching assistants are volunteers and are not paid. But we still love you!</p>

          <p>After TA'ing successfully for GDI several times, you will become eligible to take classes at a discount or for free.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Commitment</h4>

          <p>We ask that you commit to TA'ing at least one class per calendar year. Classes are taught in person in DFW. We may ask you to TA several times a year, but you are only required to TA one course. You may be required to provide (informal) feedback on course instructors.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Cancellations</h4>

          <p>If, for any reason, you are unable to TA your class (or a portion of your class), you are required to notify the chapter co-leaders at least five days in advance. This will give us time to find a replacement, reschedule, or issue cancellations and refunds.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Onboarding policy</h4>

          <h5>Pre-requisites</h5>

          <p>Prior to TA'ing your first class, you must meet with at least one chapter co-leader (preferably at a GDI event).</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Commitment</h4>

          <ul>
            <li>TA one class per calendar year</li>
            <li>Provide feedback to co-leaders on class teachers (as requested)</li>

          <h3>Teachers</h3>

          <p>Girl Develop It instructors are awesome people who love sharing their knowledge with others. You don't have to be an expert, just an enthusiastic person with experience in the field. Class format varies, ranging from a two-hour lecture to an eight-hour workshop format. You are required to teach the entirety of the workshop.</p>

          <p>At least one member of GDI staff (a co-leader of volunteer) will be present at the beginning of your workshop.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Curriculum</h4>

          <p>GDI uses nationally cultivated curriculum. The chapter co-leader will provide you with links and download instructions for the class materials and exercises are least one month prior to your class. Minor changes to the curriculum for your course are allowed, however, any substantial changes must be approved by the chapter co-leaders. What you teach is up to you, please make your preferences known to the chapter co-leaders.</p>

          <p><em>You are required to review the material prior to teaching the course.</em> If you have any questions about the materials, please notify the chapter co-leaders prior to the workshop.</p>

          <p>Curriculum is typically presented in a slideshow format using reveal.js, a special JavaScript library. You don't need any technical knowledge to run the slideshow, just open the index file in your browser and zoom away.</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Payment</h4>

          <p>GDI teachers are paid. Hooray! You will receive 50% of the student fee for the course. Optionally, you may choose to waive your fee and donate it back to the local chapter scholarship fund. Unless otherwise requested, instructors will be paid. Payment is issued by check and typically arrives 2-6 weeks after your course (depending on when forms are submitted).</p>

          <h4 class="content-subhead">Commitment</h4>
